This is a graphical port of the popular tool Wiiload, which is used to send executable files to a Nintendo Wii that is running the Homebrew Channel, or another standalone file receiver such as TCP Loader.

More information on Wiiload itself can be found here: http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Wiiload

The intention of this project is to allow for a graphical utility that can run on multiple systems, and is independent of the (system-specific) binaries supplied from Wiiload.

It doesn't only do graphics, though, run it from the command line with -h to see CLI arguments. When evoked from the command line in this manner, the GUI isn't even launched, allowing it to function in both environments. The command line version is also compatible with environment variables that regular wiiload uses if you pass them as $WIILOAD or %WIILOAD% as the first argument.
